{"connect":{"name":"CONNECT","description":"The HTTP CONNECT method starts two-way communications with the requested resource. It can be used to open a tunnel. For example, the CONNECT method can be used to access websites that use SSL (HTTPS). The client asks an HTTP Proxy server to tunnel the TCP connection to the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the Proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client. CONNECT is a hop-by-hop method.","syntax":"CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT","requestHasBody":false,"successfulResponseHasBody":true,"safe":false,"idempotent":false,"cacheable":false,"examples":["CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com:80\nProxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ="],"specifications":[{"name":"HTTP Semantics # CONNECT","link":"https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#CONNECT"}],"browserCompatibility":[{"name":"Chrome","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Edge","supported":true,"version":"12"},{"name":"Firefox","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Opera","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Safari","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Chrome Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Firefox for Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Opera Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Safari on iOS","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Samsung Internet","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"WebView Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"}]},"delete":{"name":"DELETE","description":"The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.","syntax":"DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE","requestHasBody":false,"successfulResponseHasBody":false,"safe":false,"idempotent":true,"cacheable":false,"examples":[],"specifications":[{"name":"HTTP Semantics # DELETE","link":"https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#DELETE"}],"browserCompatibility":[{"name":"Chrome","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Edge","supported":true,"version":"12"},{"name":"Firefox","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Opera","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Safari","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Chrome Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Firefox for Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Opera Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Safari on iOS","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"Samsung Internet","supported":true,"version":"Yes"},{"name":"WebView Android","supported":true,"version":"Yes"}]},"get":{"name":"GET","description":"The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.

PATCH is somewhat analogous to the \"update\" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused). A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast this with PUT; which is a complete representation of a resource. A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with PUT; which is always idempotent. The word \"idempotent\" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a PUT will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for PATCH. PATCH (like POST) may have side-effects on other resources. To find out whether a server supports PATCH, a server can advertise its support by adding it to the list in the Allow or Access-Control-Allow-Methods (for CORS) response headers. Another (implicit) indication that PATCH is allowed, is the presence of the Accept-Patch header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.","syntax":"PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH","requestHasBody":true,"successfulResponseHasBody":true,"safe":false,"idempotent":false,"cacheable":false,"examples":[],"specifications":[{"name":"RFC 5789","link":"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789"}],"browserCompatibility":[]},"post":{"name":"POST","description":"The HTTP POST method sends data to the server.

A POST request is typically sent via an HTML form and results in a change on the server. In this case, the content type is selected by putting the adequate string in the enctype attribute of the <form> element or the formenctype attribute of the <input> or <button> elements: When the POST request is sent via a method other than an HTML form — like via an XMLHttpRequest — the body can take any type.
